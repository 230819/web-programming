# Python examples

These examples are made available as Jupyter notebooks.

These are rendered on the GitHub web interface, but are not interactive.

For an interactive version, run Jupyter notebooks on your local machine by navigating to this directory (under the cloned repo) and then typing `jupyter notebook` on the command line.
